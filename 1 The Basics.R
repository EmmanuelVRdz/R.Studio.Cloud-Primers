# To make something happen in R you call a function................................

# As a new R user we should know how to do three things with the function:

# 1. If you type the name of the function by itself R will return the code that is 
# stored in the function. This is the code that R runs when you call the function.

sqrt

# 2. To run  the function you must place a pair of () after the name, and if the
# function needs the input to job place it between the ()

sqrt()
sqrt(121)

# 3. If you put a ? before the function name and run it R will open a help page of 
# the function, This is the best way to know how the function works.

?sqrt


# Comments
# R will not run anything after a #. With this you can write human readable comments
# in your code: just place the comments after the #.


# The input that you give the function is call argument............................
